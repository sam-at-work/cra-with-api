/**
 * When we use [].values(), a Babel bug means it doesn't add the
 * required polyfill when "useBuiltIns" is "usage".
 * The include of "es6.array.iterator" below, is a manual work around until the bug is fixed.
 *
 * A bug in babel-node stops --experimental-modules being passed as an argument to nodemon.
